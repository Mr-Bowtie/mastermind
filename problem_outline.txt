----- Basic Rules -----
- The player gets to choose between making the code or breaking the code. 
- The code maker creates a code made of four colors in a specific order, 
    colors can be duplicated in the code. 
- The code breaker gets 12 turns to guess the code
- after each guess the code maker returns feedback based on the guess   
    a red marker for each correct color in the correct position
    a white marker for each correct color in the wrong position 
    no marker for an incorrect color
- the feedback pins are not placed in any particular order. 

----- Program Steps -----
1. display welcome message with basic rules and available colors 
2. prompt player to choose code maker or code breaker 
3.    *code maker*
    1. the player will input their 4 color code 
    2. in a loop, the computer will guess a code
    3. the computers guess will be displayed along with the feedback markers 
    4. this repeats until the computer guesses correctly, or runs out of turns, ending the loop 
      *code breaker*
    1. in a loop, the player will make a guess at the computers code
    2. each guess will be displayed, along with the feedback markers 
    3. this repeats until the player guesses correctly or runs out of turns, ending the loop 
4. a message will display the result
5 a prompt will ask the player if they would like to run the program again
6.      *yes*
    the program starts over from the beginning 
        *no* 
    an exit message is displayed.
